### Github API test

This repository exists for me to learn about Github's REST API

### How to use
Certain operations require no authentication. See [no_auth_required](no_auth_required) as an example.
Some other do need authentication: 
- [personal_access_token](personal_access_token) shows how to do it with a personal access token.
- [webauth](webauth) shows how to do it requiring a login.
